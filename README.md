# Orhan-s-Repo
Backup for my code.
I am studying economics at Erasmus University Rotterdam. I am a self-taught python programmer. I got interested in programming because I love algorithms and problem-solving. I can't say that I am very good at it but I am gettting better. 
I am interested in finance and trading.
